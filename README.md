for Python application. This is meant for educational purposes only.

Install and Run the Client
--------------------------
1. Clone or download this repo:

  git clone git@github.com:xtuple/xtuple-python-rest-client-example.git
  ```

2. Register for an OAuth 2.0 "Services Account" Client in your xTuple Mobile
Client's "OAUTH2" interface. You will be prompted to download a PK12 keystore
file. See [OAuth 2.0 Service Accounts Scenario](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Service-Accounts-Scenario) for more information.
3. Save the PK12 keystore file in the same directory as this file and the
`contacts.py` file.
3. Edit the `contacts.py` file and set all your OAuth 2.0 Client settings. See
all of the `TODO`s in the file to find out where to do that.
4. Install the [Google APIs Client Library for Python](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation) on your system so it is available for this example to import.
5. Make sure your xTuple Mobile Client is running before running `contacts.py`.

Using the Example
-----------------
Run the `contacts.py` script from the command line:

```
$ python contacts.py
```

You should be presented with a JSON object containting a list of contacts.
